# Launch using [eksctl by Weaveworks](https://eksctl.io/)

We have some very powerful partner tools that allow us to automate much of
the experience of creating an EKS cluster, simplifying the process.

In this module, we will highlight a tool contributed by [Weaveworks](https://weave.works)
called [eksctl](https://eksctl.io), based on the official AWS CloudFormation templates,
and will use it to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.
